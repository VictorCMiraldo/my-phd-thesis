     "\"\"\"Distutils based setup script for SymPy.\n\nThis uses Distutils (http://python.org/sigs/distutils-sig/) the standard\npython mechanism for installing packages. Optionally, you can use\nSetuptools (http://pythonhosted.org/setuptools/setuptools.html)\nto automatically handle dependencies. For the easiest installation\njust type the command (you'll probably need root privileges for that):\n\n    python setup.py install\n\nThis will install the library in the default location. For instructions on\nhow to customize the install procedure read the output of:\n\n    python setup.py --help install\n\nIn addition, there are some other commands:\n\n    python setup.py clean -> will clean all trash (*.pyc and stuff)\n    python setup.py test  -> will run the complete test suite\n    python setup.py bench -> will run the complete benchmark suite\n    python setup.py audit -> will run pyflakes checker on source code\n\nTo get a full list of available commands, read the output of:\n\n    python setup.py --help-commands\n\nOr, if all else fails, feel free to write to the sympy list at\nsympy@googlegroups.com and ask for help.\n\"\"\""
